Wine Neural Network Classifier

Dataset:

winedata2.csv - This file contains the relevant data for different wine samples. You'll need to read this in to start your analysis.

Objectives:

1. Design the Neural Network:

- Architect your neural network ensuring that the output values fall between zero and one. This often implies the use of activation functions like sigmoid or softmax for the output layer.

2. Data Preparation:

- Pick any two variables from the wine dataset.
- As done previously for linear classifiers, segment the dataset into a training set and a test set.

3. Train the Neural Network:

- Dedicate half of your data for training purposes.
- Retain the other half for subsequent testing.

4. Evaluate Model Performance:

- With the neural network trained, use the test dataset to evaluate its performance.
- Calculate the accuracy metric to gauge how well your model is doing.
